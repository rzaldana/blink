# blink 🔗
A small utility that bundles a Bash script and all of its sourced files into a single, self‑contained executable.

`blink` makes it easy to distribute Bash projects that rely on multiple script files by collapsing them into one portable artifact. No more juggling `source` calls or worrying about missing dependencies.

> **Note:** This tool grew organically as a convenience for packaging my own scripts, so it currently has no dedicated unit or integration tests. I do plan to introduce proper test coverage in the future as the project evolves.
